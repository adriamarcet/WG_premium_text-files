		"As an envoy from one of the four Queens, your mission is to paint all roses with her color!",
		"The game begins! In this game you are the RED player, and you will be last to play your turn...",
		"Your turn! Place your tile clicking on the marked position or dragging the tile with your finger.",
		"Now click on the tile itself to make it rotate till there are 2 red portions on the rosebush. (It will only rotate so that the paths coincide with those on the adjacent tiles)" ,
		"Now click the \"OK\" button to accept  and complete the rosebush.",
		"Well done! One of your soldiers will move to the tile you just placed." ,
		"Your turn again. ¡Time to score a point! When you complete a rosebush , if the majority of portions are of your color, you will earn 1 point.",
		"When you complete a rosebush, all of it's portions will turn the predominant color and that player will score 1 point. But the bush will disappear if there is a tie between colors.",
		"Place and rotate the new tile in the right position to complete the rosebush and score a point!",
		"Great! You scored your first point ! The winner is the first to score 7 points.\nBut watch out ! At the same time, you could make other players score points too.",
		"Your turn again! Placing your new tile here would be great, but the rival soldiers block your way.\nYou can only place a tile on the board if your soldiers can move to it.",
		"But there is a way to place the tile there: put your second soldier in play!\nYou have 2 available soldiers in a game, so let's add the second one.",
		"Click on the soldier icon to add it to the tile.",
		"Now you can place the tile in many more places and avoid being blocked by rival soldiers.\n Place the tile in the indicated position, rotate it and accept.",
		"Well done!\nWith both soldiers in play, one will always go to the tile you place, and you’ll be able to move the other one wherever you want to try and block your opponents.",
		"Now click on the indicated position of the path and the soldier will move there. Then press the \"OK\" button to confirm.",
		"You’ve been blocked! The only way to get that soldier out of there is by retrieving him from the garden. \nIf you are blocked, by discarding a tile into the discard hat, you may retrieve a soldier of your choice from the board.",
		"Drag the tile to the bottom right corner of the screen and place it in the hat that will appear. Then press the \"OK\" button to confirm.",
		"Choose which one of the two soldiers you would like to retrieve.",
		"Well done! As usual choose the right path for your second soldier and finish your turn by pressing the \" OK\" button.",
		"Your turn again! It's time to use your magic tile ! Once per game you can turn your current tile into a magic tile with all 4 portions of your color.",
		"Press your magic symbol in the shape of a heart to activate it, and then place the tile in the marked position.",
